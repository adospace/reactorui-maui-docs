# Animation

In MauiReactor you have 3 different approaches to animation:

* Property-based animation (RxAnimation)
* AnimationController animation
* Standard MAUI.NET animation (getting a reference to the native control like described [here](../accessing-native-controls.md)) more info at official [.NET Maui documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/animation/basic)

{% hint style="info" %}
There isn't a preferred approach to animation in MauiReactor: you can even use all of them in a single component.
{% endhint %}
