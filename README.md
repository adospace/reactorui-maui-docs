# What is MauiReactor?

{% hint style="warning" %}

MauiReactor is a .NET library that implements a **component-based UI framework** on top of the .NET MAUI.&#x20;

If you already have some experience in React Native, Flutter, or Swift you may find some similarities. Actually, MauiReactor borrows some implementation designs from them while maintaining the normal MAUI application development you're used to.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** There are several design patterns you can choose when you build a UI. One of the most adopted is the MVVM (Model-View-View-Model) approach, used for years to build desktop and mobile applications. React made famous the MVU (Model-View-Update) pattern that aims to solve some issues of the first one. MAUI app defaults to MVVM while MauiReactor let you build an MAUI app using the MVU pattern.
